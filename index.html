              <p class="lead">Current SDN controllers  have  been  designed  based  on  a  monolithic architecture that aggregates all control plane subsystems  into  a  single,  huge  monolithic  program. DNOS is an ONOS application that allows us to disaggregate  the control plane services and  applications into a set of cooperative microservices. The main design goals are as follows:
          <ul>
              <li>Migrate from a monolithic approach in designing of the SDN controllers to a micro-service architecture which gives us the flexiblity to scale  a  given  service or application  horizontally and independent of other subsystems and services.</li>
               <li></li>

            <h3 class="text-center">Flexibility To Scale</h3>
            <p>One of the main advantages of DNOS arises from its ability  to  scale  a  given  service or application  horizontally, independent of other subsystems and services.

            <h3 class="text-center">Freedom  In  Choosing  The  Programming  Language</h3>
            <p>DONS provides the  opportunity to the programmers  to choose   an   arbitrary   programming   language, programming  technology,  and  third-party  library  function  when  building  an  SDN  management  application</p>

            <p>DNOS gives this flexiblity to the programmers to maintain each  services  and each  applications  in  a  separate  codebase, isolating changes.</p>
